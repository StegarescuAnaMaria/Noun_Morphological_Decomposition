# Word_Morphological_Decomposition
input: word, ouput: root + inflectional morpheme(s) +derivational morpheme(s)

We based our project on the words we could find in the dataset RoMorphoDict. We picked just the nouns from all the words.
Firstly, the stems were already part of the dataset for each word. We have come up with some algorithms of picking the inflectional and derivational morphemes, but some of the work had to be done manually (as not all words pertain to the same rules when changing form).

Lastly, with a list of morphemes and roots, we have developed an AI that would decompose a noun, and have made a small app with an imput dialogue.
